*\Make-File
*  The purpose of this was to introduce the concept of the Make instruction in UNIX.
*  Given the depency graph, I was instructe to create a custom make file that 
*  would build the dependencies in order.
*  This excercise helped developed understanding with the fork, exec, and wait 
*  instructions just like Linux uses for its standard Make files.
